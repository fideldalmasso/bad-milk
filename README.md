## What is Bad Milk
Bad Milk is a project that brings together simple games about numbers, guessing and memory. Some of them are related to basics topics in the programming world.

In addition to the games themselves, different features are included, such as: a user management system, a ranking system and a simple XOR encryption for sensitive files. 

The project was exclusively written in C++ using mainly [Zinjai](http://zinjai.sourceforge.net/), a free C++ IDE.
